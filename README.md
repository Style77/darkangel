# Darkangel

> Simple TCP botnet with functional CLI to send commands to remote devices

I did this project purely for fun, I forgot how much fun Golang gives me. However it took out as such a nice portfolio project.

## Showcase
I understand sometimes you just want to see how project works so instead of forcing you to clone repository onto your local machine, I recorded short showcase

## Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Style77/darkangel.git
cd darkangel/server
go build # Builds the server
cd ../client
go build # Builds the client
```

Now you can run the server and client on your machine.
